# Pre-trained video models with domain transfer for efficient disease detection using echocardiograms

## Project Description

Deep neural networks (DNNs) for video analysis are the cutting edge of DNN research. A major current challenge for implementing video based DNNs is scarcity of labelled videos. These models require very large amounts of training data to effectively learn. One strategy for overcoming this problem is to pre-train models using large corpuses of video data before training on task-specific videos.

We will use publicly available echocardiogram (sonogram videos of the heart) video datasets and choose state-of- the-art publicly available video model architectures to pre-train models. After deciding on a set of architectures and pre- training methods, we will produce a set of pre-trained models. These models will then be evaluated with regard to the efficiency of task-specific training on echocardiograms and their overall accuracy for disease detection.

The challenge would be to improve the training efficiency and overall accuracy of video-based disease detection models. The goal is to present a series of models with varying architectures and pre-training approaches to be tested on UCSF echocardiograms.
